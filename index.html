  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>The ILITHA Youth Development Programme is a programme that was established in 2019 October by a group of incredible, talented and determined young people who aim to develop the youth in their community. This programme is situated in Qutsa one of the rural areas of Cofimvaba/ Tsomo in Chris Hani district under Intsika Yethu municipality in ward 7.
As the ILitha Youth Development Programme we seek to provide great opportunities for young people, create a healthy and safe environment for our own community. We seek to develop disciplined, talented, educated, informed, responsible and active young people in our society. It is in our heart to see that talents and capabilities are discovered and placed into consideration in the process of our development. Our aim is to make a united, crime free and substance abuse free community.
The founders of this programme are the youth of Qutsa location who are university students and those who have matriculated. We currently have Yonela Toyisi, Sinazo Mpotulo, Linda Sijula, Asenako Ngamlana, Bukhulu Ngwenya, Sisonke Stemele, Silindokuhle Toyisi and Litha Xego. They have already invested their time in this programme sharing ideas and planning in order for the latter to succeed.
Programmes like sports, tutoring, arts and other programmes are about to be implemented to develop and search youth talent and teach them discipline so as to groom creative active young people. The ILitha Youth Development Programme is a new programme that seeks to embrace and promote the importance of culture and originality for a better future.
 
Programme background
 The Community
Our Community is faced with a high unemployment rate, increasing number of drop- outs, teenage pregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse. The above factors together with the increasing crime rate are highly influenced by lack of information and motivation. The violence committed by young people against each other is becoming out of hand for that reason we believe that the activities that come with this programme will work in sink to try and solve this issue.
The driving force of ILitha is to do something productive to save our beloved brothers and sisters from this detrimental behaviour while we assist to shape their way to success. The community participation will be of significance as this programme will be a second home of children their children, the voice for voiceless and platform to showcase the hidden talents of our community. We aim to give hope, second chances and empower each other to have a brighter future.
In our community there was never an opportunity like this programme which will be focusing on youth development. The factors like crime and teenage pregnancy are committed by young people because they donâ€™t have anything productive to do during their free time. We want our community to be known for better things than it is popular by its violent behaviour. There is a great number of learners who take gap year after matric and they never go back to school simply because they do not have information about universities or any other high institutions to further their studies.
Lastly we believe that these young people need to learn more about the importance of health and family planning to decrease the rate of teenage pregnancy as we promote healthy living lifestyle. We have realised that in rural areas the department of health is not doing enough to empower equip and raise awareness about healthy living lifestyle. As the ILitha Youth Development Programme we are willing to address, educate and have an open discussion about all these issues on the 29th of December 2019 when this programme will be introduced to the community.</p>
